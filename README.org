** markelf
Alter an ELF file's ABI compatibility identity on FreeBSD.

** Usage
#+begin_src sh
  # These alters ELF binary header and mark them
  # as 32-bit and 64-bit binary respectively. Under
  # GNU/Linux, these binaries will run just fine,
  # however a strict interpreter or future implementations
  # may override this.
  markelf <file> -c
  markelf <file> -cb

  # Same as above, except this alters the ELF OS
  # ABI. This feature is similar to brandelf.
  markelf <file> -t linux
  # or
  markelf <file> -t 3
#+end_src
